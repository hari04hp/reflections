What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder containing all the git informations regarding the git repo is created. It is necessary to process all version-control processes of git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is the intermediate between working directory and repo. It just regularizes commit like even if there are so many changes we can select particular ones
in staging area and make a single commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Instead of commiting all the logical changes in one commit, I can use the staging area to use it as a temp place to store files that contains one logical change and then
can commit those.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It  helps us to know the parent commits and let us know when we will reach detached HEAD state, when there is a possibility to lose commits and when we need to create a branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
When we merge two branches together, most of the lines that may be required by the final file is logically analyzed by Git and it merges them in case of feature addition.
Diagrammatic representation stores in our memory faster than writing.
