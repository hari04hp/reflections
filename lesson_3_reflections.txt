When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When other people than us has the needs to edit and commit codes, then a remote repository is required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Its because if git automatically pulls the local changes to itself, sometimes the incomplete functions may be committed. We already know
that combination of commits completes a feature or bug fix

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone is just making a copy of the repo from one location to other or from remote to local.
Forks is making a copy of one github account to another.
Branches is taking  a new part from existing codes in a case where  the changes should not be applied in main code till the new part is approved

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that we can edit and know the previous changes made and can merge them into newer commits done by other people.
